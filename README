PHP-Maven uses the power of Maven 3 for building, reporting on and creating documentations of PHP projects. It adapts the Maven build lifecycle to the PHP world while fully supporting PHP 5. PHP-Maven uses [PHPUnit](http://www.phpunit.de/) for unit testing and [phpDocumentor](http://www.phpdoc.org/) for creating the project documentation.

This project is forked from various repositorys by [php-maven](https://github.com/php-maven) and I'll see what I can do to get it working again. To see all my changes just take a look at the Git history of this repository.



## Getting Started
